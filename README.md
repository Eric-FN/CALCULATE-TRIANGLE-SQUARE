# Area Calculation of Square and Triangle

This project allows the user to input the base and height of both a square and a triangle in order to calculate their respective areas. The program prompts the user to input these values and then displays the calculated areas using alerts.

## üìê Code Description

- **Square Area Calculation:**
  - The user is prompted to enter the base and height of a square.
  - The area of the square is calculated using the formula: `area = base * height`.
  - An alert is displayed showing the calculated area.

- **Triangle Area Calculation:**
  - The user is prompted to enter the base and height of a triangle.
  - The area of the triangle is calculated using the formula: `area = (base * height) / 2`.
  - An alert is displayed showing the calculated area.

## How to Use

1. Open the browser's developer tools (F12) and go to the console tab.
2. Paste the code into the console and press Enter.
3. The program will prompt you to input the base and height of both the square and the triangle.
4. After entering the values, the program will calculate and display the areas in alert boxes.

## Example

1. When prompted for the square:
   - Base: 4
   - Height: 4
   - Output: `The area of the square is: 16`

2. When prompted for the triangle:
   - Base: 5
   - Height: 8
   - Output: `The area of the triangle is: 20`
